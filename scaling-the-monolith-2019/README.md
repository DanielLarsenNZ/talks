# Scaling the monolith

Monolithic applications can be notoriously difficult to scale in the Cloud. Architecture that worked well for tens of thousands of users can fail spectacularly under the load of millions of users. However, there can be great value to the business in applications that have been developed and in production for years. Do we throw away the old app and start again? Or refactor the application to scale to meet the demands of the digital economy?

This talk by Daniel Larsen, Senior Technical Evangelist at Microsoft, addresses the challenge of app modernisation and refactoring in depth with practical demos of several Cloud design patterns from the [Azure Application Architecture Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/), including _Strangler_, _Anti-corruption Layer_, _Cache Aside_, _Materialised View_ and "polygot storage". With the right combination of patterns and practices it is possible to extract new value out of old code, to scale to the next order of magnitude and to save the business money as we drive towards service oriented architecture and micro-services.
