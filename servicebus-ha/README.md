# Service Bus High Availability

This talk combines two of by favourite things: Service Bus and High Availability architectures. We will also cover the other great technologies that Service Bus enables: Event Hubs and Event Grid. And also talk about availability and recovery concepts, single region design, zone-redundant design and multi-region design.

We will define recovery once and for all. What is a "disaster" in 2020? And how can we protect ourselves from it?

This will be a fast-paced, fast-talking, fast-moving talk. So please drop your question in the chat and don't worry - all assets including slides, video and examples will be available after this talk (in this repo).
