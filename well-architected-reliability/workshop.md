# Well-architected reliability - Workshop - 3 hours

Join cloud consultant Daniel Larsen (ex-Microsoft) in an interactive architecture design session with a focus on the well-architected Framework - reliability pillar.

In this workshop we will get hands-on, gathering around a whiteboard and following a cloud-solution architecture design process that leads us to consider important aspects of reliability and resilience in cloud. 

Come prepared for a fast-paced, fun workshop that will exercise your architecture abilities and add additional skills to your cloud solution architecture practice. 

All experience levels and clouds welcome. Haere mai.
